        <p>
            I am a pianist/keyboardist/songwriter from Newark, DE. I began playing piano at four years old after my mom had one delivered to our home. Showing an unusual amount of interest for my age, I was almost immediately put into lessons. Through the years of middle school and highschool, I was entereted into numerous music theory and piano performance competetions through the College of London and passed with distinction. I attended Cab Calloway School of the Arts as a Piano performance major for highschool, and recieved a scholarship to the University of Delaware for Classical Piano Performance to continue my education. Not seeing the practicality in Classical Piano Performance at the time, I switched majors and graduated with a degree in Music Management. Since University of delaware, I have been performing and writing music with a band I co-created "Hotbed", as well as performing with other groups as needed.

            My goals are to move away from music while pursuing it more for fun. I have short-term goal of completing Code Differently's course and becoming a web/software developer. My long term goal is to continue working in back-end development and eventually build my own synthesizer

            My interest in tech grew from synthesizers. I began buying modular synthesizers that I would build my self from scratch and I began wondering how the the software was made for the digital modules. After looking further in, I began studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own to build a foundation. After a month, I joined a program with Code Differently to take my coding to the next level for front end development.
