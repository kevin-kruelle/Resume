            I am a Pianist/Keyboardist/Songwriter/Adventurer/Front End Web Developer from Newark, DE. I began playing piano at four years old after my mom had one delivered to our home. I attended Cab Calloway School of the Arts as a Piano performance major for highschool, and recieved a scholarship to the University of Delaware for Classical Piano Performance to continue my education. Not seeing the practicality in Classical Piano Performance at the time, I switched majors and graduated with a degree in Music Management. Since University of Delaware, I have been performing and writing music with a band I co-created "Hotbed", as well as performing with other groups as needed.

            My goals are to move away from music while pursuing it more for fun. I have short-term goal of completing Code Differently's course and becoming a web/software developer. My long term goal is to continue working in back-end development and eventually build my own synthesizer
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            My interest in tech grew out of my passion for music. I began buying modular synthesizers I would build my self from scratch and I began wondering how the the software was made for the digital modules. After looking further in, I began studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own to build a foundation. After a month, I joined a program with Code Differently to take my coding to the next level for front end development.
